- one version of "upstream"
- another version of "upstream"
- a consumer of "upstream", with a conda_build_config.yaml containing inexact matches for both available versions

desired result:
- 4 total nodes:
   - upstream 1.0.1
   - upstream 2.0.2
   - downstream 1.0 with dependency on upstream 1.0
   - downstream 1.0 with dependency on upstream 2.0
- 2 edges:
   - downstream 1.0 -> upstream 1.0.1
   - downstream 1.0 -> upstream 2.0.2

The key tricky thing here is getting the inexact matches present in the
matchspec for downstream to identify that they can be satisfied by the more
specific versions in the upstream builds
